'''
This is a tactical game played with two people, where each player will get 10 cards 
at random. There are two different kinds of cards, Army cards and Special cards
Each army card will have a certain rank, Ranks will be from 1-9, with 1 being the 
highest. Each card will be of a military position and the higher rank card will
overthrow the lower rank card, and the person with the higher rank card will be
awarded a point. There will also be bomb cards, which can kill any position except
a Miner(Rank 8) and there will be a Spy, which can be killed by anyone in the game, 
but if it faces off against the marshall(Rank 1), it will kill the marshall. 
A card may only be used once. First player to 5 points wins!!!
